# Digital Will Manager

## Project Description

The Digital Will Manager is a revolutionary blockchain-based inheritance management system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This decentralized application provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for managing digital wills and automating asset distribution upon execution.

The system enables individuals to create legally-backed digital wills that automatically distribute their cryptocurrency assets to designated beneficiaries through smart contract execution. By leveraging blockchain technology, the Digital Will Manager eliminates the need for traditional legal intermediaries while ensuring complete transparency and immutability of will documents.

**Key Features:**
- **Secure Will Creation**: Create tamper-proof digital wills with encrypted content storage
- **Automated Asset Distribution**: Smart contract-based automatic distribution of STX assets
- **Multi-Beneficiary Support**: Support for up to 10 beneficiaries with customizable percentage allocation
- **Executor Authorization**: Designated executor system for will execution oversight
- **Immutable Records**: All will data stored permanently on the blockchain

**Core Functions:**
1. **`create-will()`** - Create a new digital will with asset allocation and beneficiary details
2. **`execute-will()`** - Execute the will and distribute assets to beneficiaries
